**Overview of the Project:**

**Project:**

VEHICLE TRACKING SYSTEM WITH GPS AND GSM.

**Objective:**

This project isa vehicle tracking system using Arduino with GPS and GSM modules. Track the vehicle's location in real-time and send the data to a web server(Virtual Terminals) for display.
 
**Key Activities:**

•	Designing a virtual system.

•	Interfacing the GPS and GSM modules to loacte the vehicle intrem of Longitude and Latitude.

•	Interfacing the 16*2 Liquid Crystal Display.

•	Programming the Aduino.

•	Locating the vehicle's real-time location(longitude, latitiude).


**Technologies used:**

•	Arduino IDE.

•	Proteus 8 Professional.


**Key Insights:**

•	Designed a virtual system using Proteus software.

•	Arduino UNO is the main control unit of the system.

•	GPS and GSM modules are used to locate the vehicle using Longitudes and Latitudes, along with it's real-time location.

•	16*2 Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) is used to display the vehicle location.

•	Arduino IDE is used to write and debug the code.

•	Once the code is compiled a hex file is created and is used to simulate system in proteus.

**Conclusion:**

This project is demonstration of interfacing a DHT-11 sensor to read and monitor the Real-Time Temperature and Humidity.
